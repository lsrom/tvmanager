# TVManager
TVManager is simple tool for managing your downloaded TV shows. It is easy to use and works on wide variety of shows.  

## Features
Currently, only automatic renaming of files is supported. This means that you can add episode files of TV shows you have on your harddrive and have the TVManager rename them based on renaming pattern you can choose.  

## Disclaimer
In time I will write a proper Readme, but project is still in very early stages of development. Mainly there are some troubles with UI not refreshing properly, which my be because of my bad code or because of JavaFX. Both is possible.  
If you wish to use, you can, it is working well apart from the UI not showing changes to the items sometimes. But further work is required.
